🛍 Item Sales Summary Report

This project demonstrates a sales data analysis workflow using Python for data cleaning and Power BI for data modeling and visualization. The goal is to explore sales performance, profit, cost, and quantity across different years and regions.

⚙ Workflow

1. Data Collection

Import raw sales data (e.g., dimCity, dimState, factSales).



2. Data Cleaning – Python

Handle missing values.

Standardize column formats (dates, numeric values).

Remove duplicates and fix inconsistent records.

Merge dimension and fact tables into a clean dataset ready for modeling.



3. Data Modeling – Power BI

Build relationships between dimension tables and fact tables.

Define primary and foreign keys to connect data properly.



4. Data Analysis

Calculate key performance metrics:

Total Sales

Total Quantity Sold

Total Profit

Total Cost


Compare performance across fiscal years (2013–2015).

Break down results by state and other dimensions.



5. Visualization – Power BI

Interactive dashboard including:

Detailed tables (Sales, Profit, Cost, Quantity).

Visual charts (Pie chart, Bar chart, Line chart).

Dynamic filters (by Employee, City, Customer, Sales Territory, etc.).





📊 Outcomes

An interactive report showing trends in sales and profit over time.

Ability to slice and filter results by employee, city, or region.

Insights into the most profitable or costly states/territories.


🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy) → Data cleaning & preprocessing.

Power BI → Data modeling, analysis & visualization.
